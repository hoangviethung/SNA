								p My own experiences as a language learner have nurtured and strengthened the belief in offering as many opportunities as possible for my students to express their knowledge and understanding in ways that are timely, relevant, creative and unique. How has this influenced my work? Teaching English as a second, and sometimes third or fourth, language is challenging in itself. Teaching in English, where students are a mixture of near-native English speakers and those who see English more as a foreign language, is exciting. Provocative. Encouraging. Motivating. Frustrating. And rewarding. We live in an information age and schools are the heart of Information Literacy. Access to information is steered by language, making language competency a vital part of student engagement with lifelong learning.
