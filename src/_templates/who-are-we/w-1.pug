					p I am delighted to welcome you to the International Schools of North America (SNA) in the wonderfully vibrant Ho Chi Minh City. SNA has been established in the city for more than 15 years and is currently going through its most important developmental phase as we implement the three programmes of the International Baccalaureate (IBO); the Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP) and DP (Diploma Programme). As a candidate school*, we have developed a rigorous and challenging curriculum that ensures that we meet the school-wide learning objectives driven by the IB Learner Profile attributes (link to IB learner profile), thus preparing our students for the ever-changing world thanks to a truly holistic approach. We envisage being authorised to run the DP from August 2020, the PYP a little later in 2020, and the MYP from 2022. We are currently a Council of International Schools Member school (link to CIS) also in the process of seeking accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (link to WASC), both of which demonstrates alignment with a set of very exacting standards of high quality education.
					p Our school year is always very busy, full of academic and non-academic celebrations, festivals and other enriching events. In addition to the rich curriculum on offer at SNA, we also provide a varied extra-curricular after school programme of activities to enrich and enhance the studentsâ€™ experiences at SNA.
					p Our Him Lam campus opened in October 2017, and boasts an array of science laboratories, music rooms, ICT suites, art and design rooms and other specialised areas, such as a purpose-built STEM room. Our team of educators are truly global with teachers coming from many different parts of the world, working in close collaboration with their Vietnamese colleagues. The role of the community is also very important to us as at SNA and we are constantly exploring options to strengthen the partnership we have with our parents and other family members.
					p We are at a very exciting stage in our continual development and the best way to truly appreciate this is to come and visit us. As the Head of School, I would be very happy to give you a guided tour and to discuss the programmes with you, so please contact our Admissions team today to arrange your visit.
					p I look forward to welcoming you to the SNA family.
