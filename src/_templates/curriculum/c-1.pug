				p Besides educational trips, students also participate in trips to visit, explore nature, physical training, survival skills, etc. It is important during the trip that students are educated in order to develop interest and the desire to share with the community. Each trip combines visits and does charity at orphanages or nursing homes. Love is nurtured and cultivated for students from these activities.
